# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is currently being drafted and developed. There is no official release where we can claim versioning, so consider this still as a alpha phase.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Since the project is still developed there might be all kind of issues with security and such assesment is already been made during the initial development.
In case a bad practice is applied feel free to raise a ticket and it will be considered for further investigation.
Primary goal of the app is security from end user perspective, i want to avoid common injections or that values can be modified via frontend.

Feel free to reach out at the contact mentioned at README.md page.
